# Discord Stream Ended Feature - Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

We've added a comprehensive "stream ended" feature to the Discord integration that allows customizable messages when streams end, while preserving VOD links and final statistics.

## Key Features

### 1. **Customizable End Messages**
- **Per-platform messages**: Different "thanks for watching" messages for Twitch, YouTube, and Kick
- **Default fallback**: Single message for all platforms if per-platform messages aren't configured
- **Complete flexibility**: Use one, some, or all message types

### 2. **VOD Link Preservation**
- Stream URL remains clickable in the embed
- Viewers can click to watch the replay/VOD
- Footer changes to "Click for VOD" when stream ends

### 3. **Final Statistics Display**
- Viewer count labeled as "Peak Viewers" instead of "Viewers"
- Final stream thumbnail preserved
- Category/game information retained
- Stream title kept for context

### 4. **Visual Differentiation**
- Muted color scheme for ended streams (vs bright colors for live)
- Platform emoji changes to ⏹️ (stop icon)
- Title changes from "🟣 Live on Twitch" to "⏹️ Stream Ended - Twitch"
- Timestamp shows when stream ended

## Configuration

### Environment Variables (.env file)

**CRITICAL**: Messages are configuration, NOT secrets. They belong in `.env`, not Doppler/AWS/Vault.

```bash
# Default message for all platforms
DISCORD_ENDED_MESSAGE=Thanks for joining! Tune in next time 💜

# Per-platform overrides (optional)
DISCORD_ENDED_MESSAGE_TWITCH=Thanks for the amazing stream! Catch the VOD below 💜
DISCORD_ENDED_MESSAGE_YOUTUBE=Stream has ended! Watch the replay below 🎬
DISCORD_ENDED_MESSAGE_KICK=That was epic! Check out the VOD 🎮
```

### Why Not Secrets Managers?

Messages are **public-facing configuration**, not sensitive data:
- They appear publicly in Discord channels
- Don't require encryption, rotation, or access control
- Should be easy to edit without API calls
- Belong in version control with other config

**Only store secrets in Doppler/AWS/Vault:**
- Discord webhook URLs (contain tokens)
- API keys, client secrets, access tokens

## Code Changes

### New Methods in DiscordPlatform

#### `end_stream(platform_name: str, stream_data: dict, stream_url: str) -> bool`

Updates an existing Discord embed to show the stream has ended.

**What it does:**
1. Retrieves the custom ended message (per-platform or default)
2. Updates the embed with:
   - Muted color scheme
   - "Stream Ended" title
   - Custom message in description
   - "Peak Viewers" instead of "Viewers"
   - Final thumbnail
   - "Stream ended at HH:MM:SS" footer
3. Clears the message from tracking

**Parameters:**
- `platform_name`: 'Twitch', 'YouTube', or 'Kick'
- `stream_data`: Dict with title, viewer_count, thumbnail_url, game_name
- `stream_url`: VOD link (preserved in embed)

**Returns:**
- `True` if successful
- `False` if no active message exists or update fails

### Modified Methods

#### `clear_stream(platform_name: str) -> None`
- Already existed for cleanup
- Now called automatically by `end_stream()` after successful update
- Can still be called independently if needed

## Usage Example

```python
# In main daemon loop
for platform_name, username, platform in monitored_streams:
    is_live, stream_data = platform.is_live(username)
    
    if is_live:
        # Stream is live
        if platform_name in posted_streams:
            # Update existing embed
            discord.update_stream(platform_name, stream_data, stream_url)
        else:
            # Post new notification
            discord.post(message, platform_name=platform_name, stream_data=stream_data)
            posted_streams[platform_name] = stream_data
    else:
        # Stream ended
        if platform_name in posted_streams:
            # Mark as ended with custom message
            last_data = posted_streams[platform_name]
            discord.end_stream(platform_name, last_data, stream_url)
            del posted_streams[platform_name]
```

## Test Results

Successfully tested with real streams:
- **Kick/asmongold**: 8,501 viewers → Custom Kick message applied
- **Twitch/lilypita**: 61 viewers → Custom Twitch message applied
- **YouTube/grndpagaming**: Offline during test

All embeds updated successfully through the full lifecycle:
1. ✅ Initial post with live indicators
2. ✅ Updated with fresh viewer counts
3. ✅ Marked as ended with custom messages and VOD links

## Benefits

1. **Better User Experience**
   - Viewers can still access VOD after stream ends
   - Clear indication that stream has ended
   - Final stats preserved for posterity

2. **No Dead Links**
   - URLs remain clickable
   - Embeds don't need to be deleted
   - Channel history stays intact

3. **Professional Appearance**
   - Consistent branding with custom messages
   - Different tone for different audiences
   - Clean visual distinction between live and ended

4. **Flexibility**
   - Works with all three platforms
   - Can be disabled by not configuring messages
   - Graceful fallback to default message

## Next Steps

### Recommended Integration Points

1. **Main Daemon Loop**
   - Add stream end detection
   - Call `end_stream()` when `is_live()` returns False
   - Store last known stream data for final stats

2. **Configuration Documentation**
   - Add ended message examples to setup guides
   - Show different message styles (casual, professional, gaming, etc.)
   - Document multi-language support

3. **Optional Enhancements** (Future)
   - Calculate and display stream duration
   - Show peak viewer timestamp
   - Support for custom embed colors per streamer
   - Integration with Discord threads for VOD discussions

## Testing

Run the comprehensive test:

```bash
cd /home/chiefgyk3d/src/twitch-and-toot
doppler run -- python3 tests/test_discord_stream_ended.py
```

This will:
1. Post notifications for all live streams
2. Wait 10 seconds and update embeds
3. Wait 10 seconds and mark streams as ended
4. Show custom messages and preserved VOD links

## Documentation

Complete documentation available in:
- **`docs/DISCORD_STREAM_ENDED.md`** - Full feature guide
- **`DISCORD_MATRIX_SETUP.md`** - Setup and configuration
- **`README.md`** - Feature overview
- **`.env.example`** - Configuration examples

## Conclusion

This feature provides a polished, professional way to handle stream endings in Discord, maintaining engagement even after the stream concludes by preserving access to VODs while clearly indicating the stream has ended with customizable, platform-specific messaging.
