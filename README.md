# twitch-and-toot
This is a service to be run locally or on a VPS to monitor your twitch and post to your mastod when you have gone live. 

Below was generated by ChatGPT. 
ou can replace the values for client_id, client_secret, access_token, and api_base_url with the corresponding values from your Mastodon account. Replace the Client-ID header with your Twitch API client ID as well.

This script will check if ChiefGyk3D is live on Twitch every 30 seconds. If he is live, it will randomly select a message from the random_messages list
here's the systemd service file for it:

makefile

[Unit]
Description=Twitch & Toot Service

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /path/to/twitch_and_toot.py
Restart=always
RestartSec=30

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

Note:

    Don't forget to replace the placeholder values with your actual Twitch API Client ID and Mastodon access token.
    The `sys

continue

tem.exit(1)` in the script will cause the service to restart if an error occurs.

    The RestartSec value of 30 means that the service will wait for 30 seconds before restarting in case it fails.
    The WantedBy value of multi-user.target means that the service will be started automatically at system startup.

To install the service, use the following commands:

bash

sudo cp twitch_and_toot.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl enable twitch_and_toot.service
sudo systemctl start twitch_and_toot.service

You can check the status of the service using the command:

lua

sudo systemctl status twitch_and_toot.service

This should get you started with a basic implementation of a Twitch & Toot service. Let me know if you need any further assistance.
what are the dependencies to install this on debian

Here are the dependencies that you'll need to install in order to run the script on Debian:

csharp

sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip
sudo pip3 install requests

This will install Python 3 and the requests library, which is used in the script to make HTTP requests to the Twitch API and Mastodon.
