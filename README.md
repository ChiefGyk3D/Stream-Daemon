# twitch-and-toot
WORK IN PROGRESS
This is a service to be run locally or on a VPS to monitor your twitch and post to your mastodon when you have gone live. 

I am looking to grab ideas from this project here https://github.com/Siddhart/Twitch-Discord-Bot for Discord but imitate it to do the same on Mastodon.

In its current state it needs more testing but seems to work

Enter all variables into config.json

ONLY EDIT THE FOLLOWING:
    "mastodonInstance": "YOUR_MASTODON_INSTANCE_URL",
    "mastodonAccessToken":"YOUR_MASTODON_ACCESS_TOKEN",
    "twitch_clientID": "TWITCH_API_CLIENT_ID(REQUIRED)",
    "twitch_secret": "TWITCH_API_SECRET(REQUIRED)",
    "ChannelName": "STREAMER_NAME(REQUIRED)",

End goal of the project is to

1) Monitor Twitch for a specific streamer
2) Alert on Mastodon with a random set of messages once per stream
3) Alert on Mastodon with a random set of messages when the stream has ended only once per stream
4) Be kept alive as a Systemd service 
5) Able to authenticate and refresh the Oauth token on its own

You will need Twitch-CLI to grab the initial oauth token unless someone can help me code that. Most of this was generated by ChatGPT in an effort for me to learn to code a bit as well. 

Below was generated by ChatGPT. 
Note: Replace process.env.TWITCH_CLIENT_ID, process.env.TWITCH_OAUTH_TOKEN, process.env.MASTODON_ACCESS_TOKEN, and process.env.TWITCH_REFRESH_TOKEN with the appropriate values for your setup. The streamer name should also be changed to the desired streamer.
