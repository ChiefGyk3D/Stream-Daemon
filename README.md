# twitch-and-toot
This is a service to be run locally or on a VPS to monitor your twitch and post to your mastod when you have gone live. 

I am looking to grab ideas from this project here for Discord but imitate it to do the same on Mastodon

You will need Twitch-CLI to grab the initial oauth token unless someone can help me code that. Most of this was generated by ChatGPT in an effort for me to learn to code a bit as well. 

Below was generated by ChatGPT. 
Note: Replace process.env.TWITCH_CLIENT_ID, process.env.TWITCH_OAUTH_TOKEN, process.env.MASTODON_ACCESS_TOKEN, and process.env.TWITCH_REFRESH_TOKEN with the appropriate values for your setup. The streamer name should also be changed to the desired streamer.
