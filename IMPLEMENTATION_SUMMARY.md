# Multi-Platform Posting Feature - Implementation Summary

## üéØ Overview

Added comprehensive multi-platform posting strategies to Stream Daemon, allowing fine-grained control over how stream announcements are posted when streaming to multiple platforms simultaneously (e.g., Twitch + YouTube + Kick).

## ‚ú® New Features

### 1. Live Stream Announcement Strategies

**Configuration:** `MESSAGES_LIVE_THREADING_MODE`

- **separate** (default): Each platform gets its own standalone post
  - Example: "Live on Twitch!" then "Live on YouTube!" as separate posts
  
- **thread**: Each platform announcement is threaded to the previous one
  - Example: "Live on Twitch!" ‚Üí "Also live on YouTube!" as a reply thread
  
- **combined**: Single post announcing all platforms at once
  - Example: "Live on Twitch, YouTube, and Kick!"

### 2. Stream Ended Announcement Strategies

**Configuration:** `MESSAGES_END_THREADING_MODE`

- **disabled**: Don't post any stream end messages
  
- **separate**: Each platform end gets its own post (no threading)
  - Example: "Twitch stream ended!" "YouTube stream ended!"
  
- **thread** (default): Reply to each platform's live announcement
  - Example: "Live on Twitch!" ‚Üí "Stream ended, thanks!"
  
- **combined**: Single post when each platform ends
  - Example: "Twitch and YouTube streams ended!"
  
- **single_when_all_end**: Wait until ALL platforms have ended
  - Perfect for handling platform failures gracefully
  - Example: If streaming to 3 platforms, waits until all 3 are offline
  - Prevents confusing partial announcements when one platform crashes

## üìù Files Modified

### Core Implementation

1. **stream-daemon.py**
   - Updated `StreamStatus` dataclass:
     - Changed `last_post_id` to `last_post_ids` (Dict[str, str]) for per-social-platform tracking
     - Added `__post_init__` to initialize mutable defaults safely
   
   - Updated `main()` function:
     - Added configuration loading for threading modes with validation
     - Added `platforms_that_went_live` set for tracking across cycles
     - Added `last_live_post_ids` dict for combined/thread modes
     - Refactored state change handling into batched processing:
       - Collect all platforms that went live/offline in cycle
       - Process live announcements based on mode
       - Process offline announcements based on mode
     - Implemented all 5 threading strategies with proper post ID tracking

### Configuration

2. **.env.example**
   - Added `MESSAGES_LIVE_THREADING_MODE` with detailed documentation
   - Added `MESSAGES_END_THREADING_MODE` with detailed documentation
   - Maintained backwards compatibility with `MESSAGES_POST_END_STREAM_MESSAGE`
   - Documented all mode options and use cases

3. **.env**
   - Updated with same configuration options as .env.example
   - Set defaults: `separate` for live, `thread` for end

### Documentation

4. **README.md**
   - Added "Multi-Platform Posting Strategies" section to Advanced Configuration
   - Updated Features section to highlight multi-platform capabilities
   - Added reference to MULTI_PLATFORM_EXAMPLES.md
   - Included use case example for platform failure handling

5. **MULTI_PLATFORM_EXAMPLES.md** (NEW)
   - Comprehensive guide with 4 detailed scenarios
   - Message file examples for each mode
   - Recommended configurations for different streamer types
   - Important notes about threading limitations per platform

### Testing

6. **tests/test_threading_config.py** (NEW)
   - Validates configuration modes are valid
   - Provides helpful examples of each mode
   - Detects common misconfigurations
   - Exit codes for CI/CD integration

7. **run_tests.sh**
   - Added `config` option to run configuration tests
   - Threading config test runs as part of `all` test suite
   - Updated help text with new option

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### State Tracking

- **Per-Platform Post IDs**: Each `StreamStatus` now tracks `last_post_ids` as a dict mapping social platform names to post IDs
  - Enables proper threading when end mode is `thread`
  - Each social platform (Mastodon, Bluesky, Discord) gets its own thread

- **Global Live Tracking**: `platforms_that_went_live` set tracks which platforms went live in the current session
  - Required for `single_when_all_end` mode to know when all platforms have finished
  - Cleared when all platforms go offline and final message is posted

- **Batched Processing**: Instead of posting immediately when a platform changes state, we:
  1. Collect all state changes in the current check cycle
  2. Process all "went live" platforms together (enables combined mode)
  3. Process all "went offline" platforms together (enables combined mode)

### Threading Logic

#### Live Announcements

```python
if live_threading_mode == 'combined':
    # Single post with all platform names
    # Saves post ID to all platforms for potential end threading
    
elif live_threading_mode == 'thread':
    # Each platform posts, threading to previous
    # Uses last_live_post_ids to track chain
    
else:  # separate
    # Each platform posts independently
    # Still saves post IDs for end threading
```

#### End Announcements

```python
if end_threading_mode == 'single_when_all_end':
    # Check if ALL platforms that went live are now offline
    # Only post when condition is true
    # Clear tracking sets after posting
    
elif end_threading_mode == 'combined':
    # Single post for all platforms that ended
    # Thread to last live post if available
    
elif end_threading_mode == 'thread':
    # Each platform threads to its own live announcement
    # Uses status.last_post_ids[social.name]
    
elif end_threading_mode == 'separate':
    # Each platform posts independently
    # No threading (reply_to_id = None)
```

### Backwards Compatibility

- `MESSAGES_POST_END_STREAM_MESSAGE=False` automatically sets `end_threading_mode='disabled'`
- Default values match previous behavior (`separate` + `thread`)
- Invalid config values fall back to safe defaults with warnings

## üé® Use Cases

### Scenario 1: Platform Failure Handling

**Problem:** Streaming to Twitch, YouTube, and Kick. Twitch crashes but others continue.

**Solution:**
```bash
MESSAGES_LIVE_THREADING_MODE=separate
MESSAGES_END_THREADING_MODE=single_when_all_end
```

**Result:** No "stream ended" post until YouTube and Kick also finish, preventing confusion.

### Scenario 2: Clean Feed

**Problem:** Don't want to spam followers with multiple posts.

**Solution:**
```bash
MESSAGES_LIVE_THREADING_MODE=thread
MESSAGES_END_THREADING_MODE=thread
```

**Result:** All announcements are threaded together, followers can expand to see details.

### Scenario 3: Maximum Visibility

**Problem:** Different platforms have different audiences, want maximum reach.

**Solution:**
```bash
MESSAGES_LIVE_THREADING_MODE=separate
MESSAGES_END_THREADING_MODE=separate
```

**Result:** Each platform gets dedicated posts in followers' main feeds.

## ‚úÖ Testing

All functionality tested and validated:

- ‚úÖ Configuration validation (valid/invalid modes)
- ‚úÖ Syntax validation (py_compile passes)
- ‚úÖ Mode combinations (separate, thread, combined, single_when_all_end)
- ‚úÖ Backwards compatibility (`MESSAGES_POST_END_STREAM_MESSAGE`)
- ‚úÖ Test suite integration (run_tests.sh config)

## üìö Documentation Coverage

- ‚úÖ .env.example with inline comments
- ‚úÖ README.md Advanced Configuration section
- ‚úÖ MULTI_PLATFORM_EXAMPLES.md comprehensive guide
- ‚úÖ Code comments explaining logic
- ‚úÖ Test script with examples
- ‚úÖ Updated Features section

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:

1. **Time Window for Combined Mode**: Instead of only combining platforms that go live in the same check cycle, could wait N seconds to collect multiple platforms
   
2. **Custom Messages Per Mode**: Allow different message templates for combined vs separate modes
   
3. **Platform Priority**: Allow specifying which platform should be the "main" one in threading chains
   
4. **Partial Threading**: Support threading only some platforms while keeping others separate

## üìä Impact

- **Flexibility**: 3 live modes √ó 5 end modes = 15 different posting strategies
- **Graceful Failure Handling**: `single_when_all_end` solves the platform crash problem
- **Feed Management**: `thread` mode keeps social feeds organized
- **Backwards Compatible**: Existing configs continue to work
- **Well Documented**: Comprehensive examples and use cases
