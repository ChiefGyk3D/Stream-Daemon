# Stream Daemon Environment Variables
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your values
# NEVER commit .env to git!
#
# ⚠️ CRITICAL: SECRETS MANAGER PRIORITY ⚠️
#
# If you're using Doppler, AWS Secrets Manager, or HashiCorp Vault:
#
# PRIORITY ORDER (for secrets/webhooks):
# 1. Secrets Manager (Doppler/AWS/Vault) - HIGHEST PRIORITY (overrides .env)
# 2. .env file - FALLBACK (used if secret not found in secrets manager)
#
# This means:
# ✅ Production secrets in Doppler/AWS/Vault will ALWAYS be used if available
# ✅ .env values serve as fallback/defaults for development
# ✅ You can safely keep credentials in .env for local dev
# ✅ Production environments automatically use secrets manager values
#
# WHAT GETS OVERRIDDEN BY SECRETS MANAGER:
#   - API Keys (YOUTUBE_API_KEY)
#   - Client IDs and Secrets (TWITCH_CLIENT_ID, TWITCH_CLIENT_SECRET, KICK_*)
#   - Access Tokens (MASTODON_ACCESS_TOKEN, MASTODON_CLIENT_ID, MASTODON_CLIENT_SECRET)
#   - App Passwords (BLUESKY_APP_PASSWORD)
#   - Webhook URLs (DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL, DISCORD_WEBHOOK_TWITCH, etc.)
#
# WHAT STAYS IN .ENV (configuration, not secrets):
#   - Platform enables (TWITCH_ENABLE, MASTODON_ENABLE_POSTING)
#   - Usernames (TWITCH_USERNAME, YOUTUBE_USERNAME, BLUESKY_HANDLE)
#   - Public URLs (MASTODON_API_BASE_URL)
#   - App names (MASTODON_APP_NAME)
#   - Messages (DISCORD_ENDED_MESSAGE, DISCORD_ENDED_MESSAGE_TWITCH, etc.)
#   - Settings (SETTINGS_CHECK_INTERVAL)
#   - Secrets manager config (SECRETS_SECRET_MANAGER, DOPPLER_TOKEN)
#
# DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW:
#   1. Set all credentials in .env for local testing
#   2. Configure secrets manager for production
#   3. Deploy - secrets manager automatically takes priority
#   4. No need to remove .env values - they become safe fallbacks
#
# See DOPPLER_GUIDE.md for complete setup instructions!

# Comment out the credentials above and configure SECRETS section below

# YouTube Live API Credentials
# HOW TO GET:
#   1. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/
#   2. Create New Project → Name it "Stream Daemon"

# Examples: "YourChannelHandle" or "@YourChannelHandle" both work - @ is auto-added if missing
YOUTUBE_USERNAME=@YourChannelHandle
# YOUTUBE_CHANNEL_ID is OPTIONAL - will be auto-resolved from username

# MESSAGE FILES
# ===========================================
# MESSAGE FILES & POSTING STRATEGIES
# ===========================================

# Consolidated message files with platform sections
# Format: Use [PLATFORM] sections for platform-specific messages, or [DEFAULT] for all
# Example:
#   [DEFAULT]
#   Generic message 1
#   [TWITCH]
#   Twitch-specific message 1
MESSAGES_MESSAGES_FILE=messages.txt
MESSAGES_END_MESSAGES_FILE=end_messages.txt

# Control whether to use platform-specific sections or always use [DEFAULT]
# If true: Uses [TWITCH], [YOUTUBE], [KICK] sections when available, falls back to [DEFAULT]
# If false: Always uses [DEFAULT] section for all platforms (same message everywhere)
MESSAGES_USE_PLATFORM_SPECIFIC_MESSAGES=True

# ===========================================
# MULTI-PLATFORM POSTING STRATEGIES
# ===========================================

# LIVE_THREADING_MODE: How to handle "going live" posts when streaming to multiple platforms
# Options:
#   - separate: Each platform gets its own standalone post (no threading)
#               Example: "Live on Twitch!" then "Live on YouTube!" as separate posts
#   
#   - thread: Each platform announcement is threaded to the previous one
#             Example: "Live on Twitch!" → "Also live on YouTube!" as a reply thread
#   
#   - combined: Single post announcing all platforms at once
#               Example: "Live on Twitch, YouTube, and Kick!"
#               Note: In this mode, the message will include all live platforms
MESSAGES_LIVE_THREADING_MODE=separate

# END_THREADING_MODE: How to handle "stream ended" posts
# Options:
#   - disabled: Don't post any stream end messages
#   
#   - separate: Each platform end gets its own post (no threading to live announcement)
#               Example: "Twitch stream ended!" "YouTube stream ended!" as separate posts
#   
#   - thread: Each end message is threaded as a reply to that platform's live announcement
#             Example: "Live on Twitch!" → "Stream ended, thanks for watching!"
#   
#   - combined: Single post when each platform ends, listing that specific platform
#               Example: "Twitch and YouTube streams ended!" (when both end simultaneously)
#   
#   - single_when_all_end: Wait until ALL enabled streaming platforms have ended, 
#                          then post ONE final message
#                          Example: If streaming to Twitch, YouTube, and Kick, wait until
#                          all three have gone offline before posting "All streams ended!"
#                          Useful when platforms might fail at different times
MESSAGES_END_THREADING_MODE=thread

# Legacy option for backwards compatibility (if END_THREADING_MODE=disabled, this is ignored)
# Set to False to disable end messages (same as END_THREADING_MODE=disabled)
MESSAGES_POST_END_STREAM_MESSAGE=True

# =====================================

# NOTE FROM THE DEVELOPER:
#   Bluesky's app password approach is functional but frustrating. I eagerly await
#   proper OAuth 2.0 support for the masses. Currently, OAuth is only available to
#   those who self-host their own Personal Data Servers (PDS), which is overkill
#   for most users. Once Bluesky releases OAuth for everyone, we'll update to use it!

# Per-platform webhooks (OPTIONAL - overrides default webhook for specific platforms)
# Leave commented out if you want all platforms to use the same webhook
#DISCORD_WEBHOOK_TWITCH=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/TWITCH_WEBHOOK_ID/TWITCH_WEBHOOK_TOKEN

# The embed will be updated with this message while keeping the VOD link and final stats
# 
# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: These are CONFIGURATION, not secrets - keep them in .env!
# DO NOT store these in Doppler/AWS/Vault - they're not sensitive data.
#

# Matrix Protocol
# NOTE: Matrix does NOT support editing messages (unlike Discord)
#       Messages post once and stay static - no live viewer count updates
#
# HOW TO GET:
#   1. Create a Matrix account at https://app.element.io or your Matrix server
#   2. Create a room for stream announcements (e.g., "Stream Notifications")
#   3. Get Room ID:
#      - Element: Room Settings → Advanced → Internal Room ID (looks like !abc123:matrix.org)
#
# TWO AUTHENTICATION METHODS (choose ONE):
#
# Method 1: Username/Password (RECOMMENDED for bot accounts)
#   - Daemon logs in each time and gets fresh access token
#   - Automatic token rotation on every startup
#   - Best for dedicated bot accounts
#   - If BOTH username/password AND access_token are set, username/password takes priority
#
# Method 2: Access Token (alternative - manual management)
#   - Get from Element: Settings → Help & About → Advanced → Access Token → "Click to reveal"
#   - Never expires (unless manually revoked)
#   - No automatic rotation
#   - Only used if username/password are NOT set
# 
# AUTHENTICATION PRIORITY:
#   1. Username/Password (if both are set) - generates fresh token
#   2. Access Token (fallback if username/password not set) - static token
#
# DOPPLER/SECRETS MANAGER: Store each as a separate secret:
#   MATRIX_HOMESERVER = "https://matrix.chiefgyk3d.com"
#   MATRIX_USERNAME = "@streambot:matrix.chiefgyk3d.com" (Method 1 - RECOMMENDED)
#   MATRIX_PASSWORD = "your_password" (Method 1 - RECOMMENDED)
#   OR
#   MATRIX_ACCESS_TOKEN = "syt_abc123..." (Method 2 - only if not using username/password)
#   MATRIX_ROOM_ID = "!KHzbUMYDd0VnJyFqMXiPyfLipv4DKwn-stVz6RYD1VY:matrix.chiefgyk3d.com"
MATRIX_ENABLE_POSTING=False

# Required: Homeserver and Room ID
MATRIX_HOMESERVER=https://matrix.chiefgyk3d.com
MATRIX_ROOM_ID=!your_room_id:matrix.chiefgyk3d.com

# Method 1: Username/Password (RECOMMENDED - auto-generates token on each startup)
# Use this for bot accounts with automatic token rotation
MATRIX_USERNAME=@your_bot:matrix.chiefgyk3d.com
MATRIX_PASSWORD=your_bot_password

# Method 2: Access Token (alternative - only used if username/password NOT set)
# Comment out username/password above if you want to use a static access token

# Doppler Configuration
# When enabled, Doppler fetches secrets by name from your Doppler project/config
# 
# IMPORTANT: Doppler Token is ENVIRONMENT-SPECIFIC
#   - Tokens are tied to a specific Doppler environment (dev, stg, prd)
#   - A 'dev' token only accesses 'dev' secrets
#   - Generate separate tokens for different environments
#   - For most users, the 'dev' environment is sufficient
#
# How to get your Doppler token:
#   1. Go to Doppler dashboard → Access → Service Tokens
#   2. Click "Generate Service Token"
#   3. Select environment: 'dev' (recommended) or 'prd' for production
#   4. Copy the token (starts with dp.st.)
