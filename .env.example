# Stream Daemon Environment Variables
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your values
# NEVER commit .env to git!
#
# ⚠️ CRITICAL: SECRETS MANAGER USERS - READ THIS! ⚠️
#
# If you're using Doppler, AWS Secrets Manager, or Vault:
# 1. Configure the SECRETS section at the bottom of this file
# 2. COMMENT OUT all sensitive credentials (API keys, tokens, passwords, webhooks)
# 3. Keep non-sensitive settings (usernames, URLs, enable flags) uncommented
#
# WHY? Environment variables take PRIORITY over secrets managers!
# If a credential is set in .env, Stream Daemon will NEVER fetch it from Doppler/AWS/Vault.
# 
# Example - Using Doppler for Twitch:
#   TWITCH_ENABLE=True                    ← Keep (non-sensitive)
#   TWITCH_USERNAME=chiefgyk3d           ← Keep (non-sensitive)
#   # TWITCH_CLIENT_ID=abc123            ← COMMENT OUT (let Doppler provide it)
#   # TWITCH_CLIENT_SECRET=xyz789        ← COMMENT OUT (let Doppler provide it)
#
# What to COMMENT OUT when using secrets managers:
#   - API Keys (YOUTUBE_API_KEY)
#   - Client IDs and Secrets (TWITCH_CLIENT_ID, TWITCH_CLIENT_SECRET, KICK_*)
#   - Access Tokens (MASTODON_ACCESS_TOKEN, MASTODON_CLIENT_ID, MASTODON_CLIENT_SECRET)
#   - App Passwords (BLUESKY_APP_PASSWORD)
#   - Webhook URLs (DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL)
#
# What to KEEP when using secrets managers:
#   - Platform enables (TWITCH_ENABLE, MASTODON_ENABLE_POSTING)
#   - Usernames (TWITCH_USERNAME, YOUTUBE_USERNAME, BLUESKY_HANDLE)
#   - Public URLs (MASTODON_API_BASE_URL)
#   - App names (MASTODON_APP_NAME)
#   - Settings (SETTINGS_CHECK_INTERVAL, MESSAGES_*)
#   - Secrets manager config (SECRETS_SECRET_MANAGER, DOPPLER_TOKEN)
#
# See DOPPLER_GUIDE.md for complete setup instructions!

# MESSAGE FILES
# ===========================================
# MESSAGE FILES & POSTING STRATEGIES
# ===========================================

# Consolidated message files with platform sections
# Format: Use [PLATFORM] sections for platform-specific messages, or [DEFAULT] for all
# Example:
#   [DEFAULT]
#   Generic message 1
#   [TWITCH]
#   Twitch-specific message 1
MESSAGES_MESSAGES_FILE=messages.txt
MESSAGES_END_MESSAGES_FILE=end_messages.txt

# Control whether to use platform-specific sections or always use [DEFAULT]
# If true: Uses [TWITCH], [YOUTUBE], [KICK] sections when available, falls back to [DEFAULT]
# If false: Always uses [DEFAULT] section for all platforms (same message everywhere)
MESSAGES_USE_PLATFORM_SPECIFIC_MESSAGES=True

# ===========================================
# MULTI-PLATFORM POSTING STRATEGIES
# ===========================================

# LIVE_THREADING_MODE: How to handle "going live" posts when streaming to multiple platforms
# Options:
#   - separate: Each platform gets its own standalone post (no threading)
#               Example: "Live on Twitch!" then "Live on YouTube!" as separate posts
#   
#   - thread: Each platform announcement is threaded to the previous one
#             Example: "Live on Twitch!" → "Also live on YouTube!" as a reply thread
#   
#   - combined: Single post announcing all platforms at once
#               Example: "Live on Twitch, YouTube, and Kick!"
#               Note: In this mode, the message will include all live platforms
MESSAGES_LIVE_THREADING_MODE=separate

# END_THREADING_MODE: How to handle "stream ended" posts
# Options:
#   - disabled: Don't post any stream end messages
#   
#   - separate: Each platform end gets its own post (no threading to live announcement)
#               Example: "Twitch stream ended!" "YouTube stream ended!" as separate posts
#   
#   - thread: Each end message is threaded as a reply to that platform's live announcement
#             Example: "Live on Twitch!" → "Stream ended, thanks for watching!"
#   
#   - combined: Single post when each platform ends, listing that specific platform
#               Example: "Twitch and YouTube streams ended!" (when both end simultaneously)
#   
#   - single_when_all_end: Wait until ALL enabled streaming platforms have ended, 
#                          then post ONE final message
#                          Example: If streaming to Twitch, YouTube, and Kick, wait until
#                          all three have gone offline before posting "All streams ended!"
#                          Useful when platforms might fail at different times
MESSAGES_END_THREADING_MODE=thread

# Legacy option for backwards compatibility (if END_THREADING_MODE=disabled, this is ignored)
# Set to False to disable end messages (same as END_THREADING_MODE=disabled)
MESSAGES_POST_END_STREAM_MESSAGE=True

# =====================================

#   Bluesky's app password approach is functional but frustrating. I eagerly await
#   proper OAuth 2.0 support for the masses. Currently, OAuth is only available to
#   those who self-host their own Personal Data Servers (PDS), which is overkill
#   for most users. Once Bluesky releases OAuth for everyone, we'll update to use it!

# Doppler Configuration
# When enabled, Doppler fetches secrets by name from your Doppler project/config
# 
# IMPORTANT: Doppler Token is ENVIRONMENT-SPECIFIC
#   - Tokens are tied to a specific Doppler environment (dev, stg, prd)
#   - A 'dev' token only accesses 'dev' secrets
#   - Generate separate tokens for different environments
#   - For most users, the 'dev' environment is sufficient
#
# How to get your Doppler token:
#   1. Go to Doppler dashboard → Access → Service Tokens
#   2. Click "Generate Service Token"
#   3. Select environment: 'dev' (recommended) or 'prd' for production
#   4. Copy the token (starts with dp.st.)
#
# See DOPPLER_GUIDE.md for complete setup instructions

# POST_INTERVAL: How often to check stream status when LIVE (in minutes)
